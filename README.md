# Social-Network-API-NoSQL

## Goal:

To create an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so a website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Description:

1) When a user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
2) When a user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
3) When a tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database
4) When a user tests API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
